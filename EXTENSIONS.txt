1. How to handle domains beyond Amazon.com:

Scraping domains beyond Amazon can be achieved by using a For iterator and 
looping over multiple urls. Example:

for (let i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) {
    const url = urls[i];
    await page.goto(`${url}`);
}


2. How to handle products beyond just books:

Instead of using Puppeteer to search for books, we can type different product categories in the textbox. 
Additionally, we an also bypass typing in a search field and simply just click the input. 

For example, 

await page.goto('http://amazon.com/');
    await page.click('input.nav-input')
    await page.waitForSelector('#resultsCol')
